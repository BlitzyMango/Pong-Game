# Pong Game
## Overview
A simple game of Pong developed using the pygame module on Python.

## How to Run
Currently, this repository does not have an executable for running the Pong game. It can only be run (or edited) using a Python interpreter/virtual environment that satisfies the following requirements:
- Uses Python version 3.6 or higher
- Has the `pygame` and `asyncio` modules installed, which can be obtained using the following command:
  ```
  pip install pygame, asyncio
  ```
If these requirements are met, you may start up an instance of Pong by running `pong.py` using one of these commands:
### MacOS/Linux
```
python3 pong.py
```
### Windows
```
python pong.py
```
